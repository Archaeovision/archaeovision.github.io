# About
At Archaeovision, our mission is to make the world a little better by helping museums and cultural heritage institutions digitally preserve and provide meaningful access to our shared cultural heritage.

We collaborate with you to create customised technology solutions for your unique collections needs. Our services aim to care for the past while inspiring community connections.

Everything we do is grounded in our core values:
- _Openness_ - We prioritise free, public access to human heritage. Our tools promote open data and transparent processes.
- _Ethics_ - We adhere to sustainable practices and consider our impact on people and the planet.
- _Partnership_ - Your needs come first. We work as trusted advisors, not just vendors.
- _Preservation_ - We share a duty to carefully safeguard artifacts for future generations. Our work must reflect that commitment.
- _Accessibility_ - Our solutions break down barriers to foster understanding between cultures. The past belongs to all.

At Archaeovision, we focus on purpose-driven technology. Our skilled team could work anywhere, but we choose projects that ignite our passion for sharing the stories of where weâ€™ve been. We aspire to give back more than we take.

### If our values resonate with you, we would be honored to explore how we can partner to enrich access to our shared heritage.
